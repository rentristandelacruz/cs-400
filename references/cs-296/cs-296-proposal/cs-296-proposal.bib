abstract = "Starting from the way the inter-cellular communication takes place by means of protein channels (and also from the standard knowledge about neuron functioning), we propose a computing model called a tissue P system, which processes symbols in a multiset rewriting sense, in a net of cells. Each cell has a finite state memory, processes multisets of symbol-impulses, and can send impulses (“excitations”) to the neighboring cells. Such cell nets are shown to be rather powerful: they can simulate a Turing machine even when using a small number of cells, each of them having a small number of states. Moreover, in the case when each cell works in the maximal manner and it can excite all the cells to which it can send impulses, then one can easily solve the Hamiltonian Path Problem in linear time. A new characterization of the Parikh images of ET0L languages is also obtained in this framework. Besides such basic results, the paper provides a series of suggestions for further research."

abstract = "We introduce a new computability model, of a distributed parallel type, based on the notion of a membrane structure. Such a structure consists of several cell-like membranes, recurrently placed inside a unique “skin” membrane. A plane representation is a Venn diagram without intersected sets and with a unique superset. In the regions delimited by the membranes there are placed objects. These objects are assumed to evolve: each object can be transformed in other objects, can pass through a membrane, or can dissolve the membrane in which it is placed. A priority relation between evolution rules can be considered. The evolution is done in parallel for all objects able to evolve. In this way, we obtain a computing device (we call it a P system): start with a certain number of objects in a certain membrane and let the system evolve; if it will halt (no object can further evolve), then the computation is finished, with the result given as the number of objects in a specified membrane. If the development of the system goes forever, then the computation fails to have an output. We prove that the P systems with the possibility of objects to cooperate characterize the recursively enumerable sets of natural numbers; moreover, systems with only two membranes suffice. In fact, we do not need cooperating rules, but we only use catalysts, specified objects which are present in the rules but are not modified by the rule application. One catalyst suffices. A variant is also considered, with the objects being strings over a given alphabet. The evolution rules are now based on string transformations. We investigate the case when either the rewriting operation from Chomsky grammars (with respect to context-free productions) or the splicing operation from H systems investigated in the DNA computing is used. In both cases, characterizations of recursively enumerable languages are obtained by very simple P systems: with three membranes in the rewriting case and four in the splicing case. Several open problems and directions for further research are formulated"

abstract="The paper deals with the vivid area of computing with membranes (P systems). We improve here two recent results about the socalled P systems with active membranes. First, we show that the Hamiltonian Path Problem can be solved in polynomial time by P systems with active membranes where the membranes are only divided into two new membranes (a result of this type was obtained by Krishna and Rama, [4], but making use of the possibility of dividing a membrane in an arbitrary number of new membranes). We also show that HPP can be solved in polynomial time also by a variant of P systems, with the possibility of dividing non-elementary membranes under the influence of objects present in them. Then, we show that membrane division (and even membrane dissolving) is not necessary in order to show that such systems are computationally complete.",

abstract="In the attempt to have a framework where the computation is done by communication only, we consider the biological phenomenon of trans-membrane transport of couples of chemicals (one say symport when two chemicals pass together through a membrane, in the same direction, and antiport when two chemicals pass simultaneously through a membrane, in opposite directions). Surprisingly enough, membrane systems without changing (evolving) the used objects and with the communication based on rules of this type are computationally complete, and this result is achieved even for pairs of communicated objects (as encountered in biology). Five membranes are used; the number of membranes is reduced to two if more than two chemicals may collaborate when passing through membranes.",
